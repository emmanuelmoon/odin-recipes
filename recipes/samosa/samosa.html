    <h2>Perfectly flaky, crispy, and delicious snack</h2>
    <p>A samosa is a fried or baked pastry with a savory filling, including ingredients such as spiced potatoes, onions,
        peas, chicken and/or other meats. It may take different forms, including triangular, cone, or half-moon shapes,
        depending on the region. In this recipe we'll be using minced chicken.</p>

        <li>4 - 5 tablespoon flour or atta</li>
        <li>Oil(for frying)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Put the mince and water (about 1 ½ cups - 2 cups) in a saucepan.</li>
        <li> Add salt, red chili powder, ginger garlic paste, coriander poweder and a few drops of oil.</li>
        <li>Bring the mince to a boil, and cook till water is evaporated and mince is cooked through.</li>
        <li>Take out the mince in a large bowl, and set it aside to cool.</li>
        <li> Add roasted cumin seeds, garam masala and red chili flakes to the cooked mince and mix well. At this point,
            the mince mixture can be kept in the freezer if needed.</li>
        <li>Add the onion, coriander, green chili and mint (if usinto the mince mixture and mix through. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Mix flour and water in a small bowl to make a thick paste.</li>
        <li>Fill the samosa patti with the mince mixture (about 1 - 2 teaspoon of the filling), and fold it into a
            triangular shape using the sticky flour mixture to glue it shut.</li>
        <li>The samosas can be fried off right away, or frozen to use another day.</li>
        <li>To freeze, place the samosas on a tray making sure they don’t touch each other. Keep the tray in the freezer
            for
            about 30 - 45 minutes till the samosas are frozen. Once the samosas are frozen, they can be removed
            individually
            and put in a plastic bag. Spray oil on the tray to make sure the samosas don’t stick to the bottom.</li>
        <li>To fry, just take the frozen samosas out of the freezer and place in medium heat oil. Fry till golden brown.
            Frozen samosas will take 1 -2 minutes longer to cook compared to fresh samosas.</li>
